The roadsides along French roads represent nearly 5,000 km¬≤, thus constituting a biomass potential that has not yet been recovered. Thus, considering roadsides as a source of sustainable bioeconomy requires a change in practices in order to better exploit this potential. Several studies have highlighted the importance of territorial demonstrators for the implementation of practices and emerging supply chains. In this perspective, this article seeks to propose a conceptual framework for the implementation of a demonstrator for the sustainable management of roadsides for valorization purposes, based on the cross-referencing of information from the literature on demonstrators and on the sustainable supply chain.","tags":["axe4"],"title":"Recovery of roadside biomass: the contribution of demonstrators to the deployment of a sustainable supply chain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brunelle Marche","Brice Corrigeux","Mauricio Camargo","Christophe Bachmann"],"categories":null,"content":"Article √† para√Ætre\n","date":1712448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699027080,"objectID":"3e915e137302b856e7825831d3e1385b","permalink":"https://erpi-ul.github.io/SAGID/en/publication/axe-3/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/SAGID/en/publication/axe-3/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Within the framework of the bioeconomy, a value chain resulting from the valorization of grass roadside verges maintenance activities is currently emerging. It represents a potential sink of biomass which could be valorized as source of energy (heat or electricity) or others applications, thanks to the availability of technologies and the growing biomass demand. However, the assessment of these emerging activities could not any longer be made exclusively under technical and economic considerations. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to evaluate these new activities from a more holistic manner, especially regarding their environmental impact. The present paper aims to introduce the carbon footprint analysis as an environmental indicator for establishing the relevance of the maintenance strategies with and without biomass recovery. Results show that the carbon footprint of this emerging valorization value chain could be positive, compared to the traditional maintenance strategy when including the valorization activities.","tags":["axe3"],"title":"Towards a carbon footprint analysis as an extended environmental indicator for roadside maintenance strategies: a multiscale perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brice Corrigeux"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Welcome to Ziadany Mayoral Solis, who joined the SAGID+ chair as a doctoral candidate on Monday, October 9th.

In this sense, the ecosystems known as road verges are particularly important because of their length and surface at an international scale, and their role in mitigating the damage done by roads. Plant pollination by insects is one of the most important ecosystem services. Because of its nature and the fact that they extend across a variety of landscapes, roadside can contribute to the maintenance of healthy ecosystems, under the condition of adapted management practices. This research is the first attempt to develop a System Dynamics-based aiming to estimate the ecological and economic impact of maintenance on the road verge pollination service in France. Maintenance strategies of road verges are simulated to compare their performance. The results show that there are ways to improve current maintenance strategies in terms of pollination value, but also that the model needs to consider other ecosystem services and synergistic effects that could further affect pollination to obtain more accurate estimations.","tags":["axe1"],"title":"Towards a Modeling of the Impacts of Road Verge Management on the Pollination Service Using System Dynamics: A Case Study in France","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brunelle Marche","Brice Corrigeux","Johan Artunduaga","Mauricio Camargo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699027080,"objectID":"9cb2fe551b258f4e0bdf8e95a684cdfb","permalink":"https://erpi-ul.github.io/SAGID/en/publication/axe-4/observatoire/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/SAGID/en/publication/axe-4/observatoire/","section":"publication","summary":"The objective is to assess the state of roadside maintenance practices at the departmental level in order to identify and formalize maintenance scenarios.

However, vegetative strips that border them, called roadsides, can mitigate, and even provide additional ecosystem services to the society (biodiversity preservation, water and air filtration,‚Ä¶). Mainly for security reasons, these roadsides must be regularly maintained. Inappropriate roadside management can lead to the decrease in ecosystem services (spread of invasive plants, habitats destruction or modification of the environment by soil enrichment among others). As roadside maintenance is highly recommended, the aim of this review is to identify technological solutions allowing to reduce management effects on ecosystem services provided by roadsides. Based on a systematic review of the scientific literature, five sensor technologies solutions were finally selected: the detection of rare, protected, or invasive plant species, the detection of animals, the automated control of ditches, the assessment of biomass quantity and carbon storage and the assessment of cultural services provided by roadsides.","tags":["axe2"],"title":"Identification of Sensor Technologies with the Potential to Support Roadside Ecosystem Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adriana-Simona Mihaita","Brunelle Marche","Mauricio Camargo","Iman Rahimi","Christophe Bachmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699027080,"objectID":"e1c19cad9788e53483d66fb3be5bbe7a","permalink":"https://erpi-ul.github.io/SAGID/en/publication/axe-2/mihaita2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/SAGID/en/publication/axe-2/mihaita2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Roadside maintenance is a significant challenge for many territories worldwide. For safety reasons, these roadsides have to be maintained regularly, which has a substantial economic impact requiring a significant investment of staff and material. This paper addresses the problem of planning optimal trajectories of mowing machines within a dedicated territory in order to meet several objective criteria such as: minimising the travel distance, the number of mowing machines, as well as minimising the time and the cost associated with each yearly operation. Firstly, we define the mathematical methodology of the multi-objective criteria that we need to calculate. Secondly, we propose a clustering approach based on the k-means algorithm in order to identify the best sub-sectors of road sections that each technical centre needs to plan in order and maintain using existing equipment. Thirdly, we apply an optimal routing between each cluster based on TomTom API routing and identify the distance used to formulate our multi-objective optimisation criteria to minimise the cost and the use time associated with various mowing scenarios. Finally, we analyse the best setup to satisfy all criteria in the current case study area and present future projections of a local versus global optimisation approach.","tags":["axe2"],"title":"Multi-Objective Modelling of a Roadside Mowing Problem: A Case Study in France","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brunelle Marche","Mauricio Camargo","Sandra Cecilia Bautista Rodriguez","Cl√©mence Chaudron","Fr√©d√©rique Mayer","Christophe Bachmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699027080,"objectID":"968a23cd50b25f5b8c2c5d418a6e030a","permalink":"https://erpi-ul.github.io/SAGID/en/publication/axe-1/marche2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/SAGID/en/publication/axe-1/marche2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

For this reason, future road management systems should include all the different dimensions of sustainability. However, sustainable management of roadsides can be considered a complex and dynamic process. It requires access to data, from communities, maintenance services, suppliers of mowing equipment, and the roadsides themselves (physiognomy of the terrain, the composition of the soil, biodiversity, the composition of the area to be mowed and pruned, etc.). Therefore, the current development of Industry 4.0 opens opportunities to capture, aggregate, and analyze the information needed to support decision-making by territory planners and to provide the network's various stakeholders with complete visibility. Although generic models for decision-making in big data environments have been proposed in the scientific literature, they fail to deal with the specific characteristics and data requirements of such a system. In this context, this paper proposes the integration of a process based on the dynamic systems theory and the Industry 4.0 paradigm to achieve sustainable management of roadside processing.
