We participated in the 6th edition of the IDRRIM Congress held on March 26th and 27th, 2024, in Montpellier on the theme "Mobility and Climate Change Disruption: Techniques, Trades, and Methods for Transitioning Infrastructures."

This was an opportunity for us to gain insights into the major trends in the evolution of transportation infrastructures and to network with professionals in the field.

We were particularly interested in the plenary session on the energy valorization of green dependencies. The discussion mainly revolved around the development of photovoltaics. Thierry Cayret's presentation from the Gers Departmental Council on the valorization of pruning wood particularly caught our attention.

During break times, we also had the opportunity to establish contacts and present the SAGID+ project to several departmental councils. The topic of creating a community around roadside green dependencies was also discussed with IDRRIM, with the idea of ​​creating a space for exchange for managers that could be informed by various research projects.
