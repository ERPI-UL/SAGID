    title: "Roadside"
    text: |-
      Transport infrastructures, comprising roadways and their associated green areas, are central to concerns related to the sustainable development of territories. They involve both environmental preservation and economic aspects associated with transportation, road safety, and quality of life, among others.

      The consequences of choices made by public authorities, particularly in terms of planning and maintenance of these spaces, have long-term implications. Indeed, a transport infrastructure must provide service to users, including accessibility, travel time, comfort, safety, while also integrating into its environment. These social, economic, and environmental functions depend on the quality of the environment and, therefore, on the management practices implemented in the territory.

    title: The chair SAGID+
    text: |-
      This chair places special emphasis on roadside and is interested in establishing sustainable management of these vegetated spaces, with the ability to mitigate the negative impacts of roads on biodiversity and play a fundamental role in its preservation. However, currently, various stakeholders at the territorial level lack operational methodologies/models that enable them to simultaneously consider and assess all the previously mentioned challenges.

      Recent studies have shown that current research on roadside management is approached in a fragmented and disciplinary manner. They have also highlighted a lack of formal models for addressing the complexity of such a system and integrating data from various sources and disciplines.

      The overall goal of the chair is to develop 'turnkey' tools and methods capable of assessing the sustainability of practices implemented in the decision-making process, supported by artificial intelligence, and then contribute to integrating the profession into bioeconomy sectors and promoting eco-responsible behaviors.

      The SAGID+ project is co-funded by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund with a total of €409,500, along with contributions from the ACTIBAC group and the Greater Nancy Metropolitan Area. It contributes to the collective ambition 'Men and Trees, the Roots of Tomorrow,' which is labeled as a Territory of Innovation. It has also received the 'Solar Impulse Efficient Solution Label' certification.
