title: "Recovery of roadside biomass: the contribution of demonstrators to the deployment of a sustainable supply chain"
abstract: "The current context marked by the acceleration of climate change, the scarcity of resources and geopolitical tensions implies a review of the French energy strategy, giving priority to biomass-energy as the main source of renewable energy. The roadsides along French roads represent nearly 5,000 kmÂ², thus constituting a biomass potential that has not yet been recovered. Thus, considering roadsides as a source of sustainable bioeconomy requires a change in practices in order to better exploit this potential. Several studies have highlighted the importance of territorial demonstrators for the implementation of practices and emerging supply chains. In this perspective, this article seeks to propose a conceptual framework for the implementation of a demonstrator for the sustainable management of roadsides for valorization purposes, based on the cross-referencing of information from the literature on demonstrators and on the sustainable supply chain."
