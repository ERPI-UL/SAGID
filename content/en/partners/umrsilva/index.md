title: UMR SILVA
summary: |-
  The UMR Silva brings together researchers from AgroParisTech, INRAE, and the University of Lorraine to conduct interdisciplinary research on wood, trees, and forest ecosystems. Its objectives include developing fundamental and applied research to address societal questions, particularly those of forest managers, regarding the adaptation of forest ecosystems to global changes and the services they provide, such as wood production or their contribution to climate change mitigation.

  Within the chair, UMR Silva contributes its expertise in ecology to characterize the ecosystem services provided by roadside areas and improve management practices while considering these externalities.
