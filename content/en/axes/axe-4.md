    text: |-      
      This axis aims to support territories by making the chair a space for the exchange, dissemination, and provision of knowledge through the demonstration of tools/methods developed in the previous axes, by training, and by showcasing best practices in experimental territories.

      This research axis can itself be broken down into different activities:

      Demonstrating sustainable roadside management by validating the proper functioning of the developed tools and serving as a showcase for best practices for territories and the general public.
      Training local stakeholders to highlight the benefits of systemic approaches in decision-making processes.
      Dissemination, communication, and exploitation of demonstration results with the goal of encouraging a shift toward sustainable practices.

      The current progress and results of this axis are as follows:
