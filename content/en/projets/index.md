      The research and development project RESP'HAIES (RESilience and Performance of Agricultural Farms linked to HEDGES) took place from 2019 to 2022 with the objective of strengthening knowledge about hedges. Coordinated by Afac-Agroforesteries, this project benefited from the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty.
      
      The objectives of this project were very similar to those targeted by SAGID+:

      Produce new tools and benchmarks that will be made available to farmers and all stakeholders involved in hedge-related activities (agroforestry advisors, territorial managers, educators, learners).
      Guide public action in favor of hedges.
      Through these new knowledge and tools, the ultimate goal of this project was to strengthen the establishment, sustainable management, and valorization of hedges so that they contribute to the resilience of agricultural farms and rural territories, as well as their economic, environmental, and socio-territorial performances.

      More information and the results of the project are available on the [RESP'HAIES project website](https://afac-agroforesteries.fr/resphaies/).

      The BISON project (Biodiversity and Infrastructure Synergies and Opportunities for European Transport Networks) brought together 42 partners from 17 countries.

      It aimed to improve the reliability of infrastructures in the context of climate change adaptation by identifying best practices to limit, in particular, the presence of invasive exotic species and habitat fragmentation.

      All information and results can be found on [the project website](https://bison-transport.eu/#about).
